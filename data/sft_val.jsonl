Time outs are also often used without letting the child know how they’re getting out of the time out, which can make it feel arbitrary or like a punishment, rather than a consequence for something they did.  It’s really easy for adults to do this kind of thing unconsciously.  It’s easy to get caught up in the notion that “They’re in time out, and that’s the end of it!” but kids can be pretty imaginative, and they can use their own creativity to make their way out of time outs.  A compassionate time out ends when the child shows a sign of understanding what they’ve done wrong, and are ready to begin again.  That way the child knows they’re learning, and that the parent is seeing them as an intelligent person, even if they sometimes mess up.  You can still use the other techniques you were using to be tough when necessary, but using a compassionate approach will let you use them without actually using them!\n\n\nHuman"}]}

The first is to put a robot in the car, which is kind of like a remote-control helicopter. The robot would have a video camera, some artificial intelligence, and some sensors. When you are driving, you would be able to see out the window and steer and accelerate and brake with a joystick or other controls, so it’s like you are driving, but you aren’t. You’d control the robot, and the robot would control the car. If you wanted to be super safe, you could build an extra sensor in the car that would only drive in the safest conditions, and when there were hazards, or if the car sensed the driver wasn’t doing what they should, then the robot would actually take over control of the car and drive it instead. This is the safer way, but it would also be kind of slow because the robot would just be doing the exact same thing that you would have done, and if you messed up, the robot would also mess up. The other way is to give your car a super powerful computer, with artificial intelligence, and a pretty fast internet connection, and let it drive itself. This car would also have some sensors, but it wouldn’t really need them, because it would always have access to so much more information than you do. When you are driving, you would choose where you want"}]}

However, you can lower the impact of spicy foods on your body.  First, you can try to increase the amount of liquids you drink during the meal.  For example, drinking water before, during, and after eating.  Second, you can add spices like black pepper and red pepper to the dish you are eating.  These spices can help reduce the discomfort of spicy foods.  Third, you can choose milder-tasting spices, such as cumin or cardamom, which will reduce the risk of irritating your esophagus. \nAnother way to reduce the impact of spicy foods on your body is to eat them in smaller amounts or spread them out over a longer time period.  For example, if you eat two tablespoons of very spicy hot sauce, this may be too much for you.  You can try eating one teaspoon of the hot sauce each day for a week.  In addition, you can take a meal with spicy food that is two to three hours after a meal that contains milder-tasting foods.  This will also reduce the likelihood that spicy foods will cause"}]}

However, there are several factors you can look at to try to determine which type of grief you have.  First, if you feel very sad or depressed after a loss, that’s generally a sign that you’re feeling grief.  The important thing is to be careful not to let those feelings of depression and sadness prevent you from doing the things you need to do in order to feel better, such as reaching out to friends and family members, and following a healthy eating and sleeping routine.  Another sign that you’re experiencing grief is that you might feel angry at people or things that have nothing to do with your loss.  If you’re angry, or feel that you’re being mistreated, it’s a sign that you are experiencing grief.  Again, though, this feeling is common and doesn’t always mean that you are experiencing grief.  If you feel both sad and angry, but you also feel worried and depressed, that’s usually a sign that you are experiencing complicated grief."}]}

The player with the most of these gets to be ‘X’, the other gets to be ‘O’.  \n\nYou can start by asking your brother to make the first move, and if he doesn’t know what to do, just tell him “Here’s how you play: You can only put your mark in a space that is unoccupied and where you can still play, so look around, and if you see a space that you like, just play your mark in it, and then it’s your turn to choose again”. You could also help him think through strategies and explain how you’d play, or how he should play."}]}

It’s easier to use a double boiler, which you can put on the stove and heat water in, but it’s also okay if you just use a small pan.  First you’ll need to heat the water in a pan over a stove or fire, but not enough that it will start boiling.  Once the water starts boiling, slowly add the wax into the water.  As soon as the wax is in the water, you want to stir it to create a thicker layer of wax, so it doesn’t dissolve into the water, but a little bit will melt.  That’s important to avoid wax in the bottom of your candles and extra wax in your fingers.  When the wax has melted, you should notice that the water is getting cloudy, and that means it is saturated with wax and it’s safe to add the wick."}]}

When the surface of a piece of meat is exposed to the air, bacteria start growing and it can go bad. The longer it’s outside, the more bacteria it can accumulate. That’s why we cook meat -- to kill off most of the bacteria, since that’s what makes it rot.  If you freeze it, then it has very few bacteria because the cells are frozen and they stop growing. The thing is, after you defrost the meat, all of those bacteria start growing again, so you should put the meat right into the fridge after thawing."}]}

Unfortunately, the situation is still in an unclear and unresolved state, and there is no clear path forward.  Each country claims Kashmir as their own.

There are several definitions for a sphere, but probably what you want is something called the “geometric” definition of a sphere.  There are a few ways to do this, but one way is to imagine that the sphere has been flattened out on a piece of paper.  The area of the paper is defined by a formula called “Pi”, which is approximately 3.1416...  if the radius of the sphere is “R”, the area of the circle would be approximately Pi*R2, and the “volume” would be the area multiplied by the height.  But usually the sphere is not “flattened out” in our imagination, and you need to estimate how the volume of a sphere changes when it’s not flattened out."}]}

This deposit usually is equal to the amount of credit that you charge to the card.  Some secured credit cards may also require you to pay a fee.  The card issuer is taking on more risk by offering the credit card to you.  If you don’t pay, then they lose the money that they invested in you.  On the other hand, a credit card without a security deposit is considered “unsecured.”  The credit card company doesn’t need to think they will lose the money they invested in you."}]}

There’s actually a significant market for organic eggs.  My understanding of the topic is that the regulations regarding organic eggs are somewhat inconsistent, but that generally all or almost all the ingredients used in the feed to feed chickens to produce eggs are organic.  However, there’s an additional cost involved in the extra steps required to ensure that organic rules are followed.

If you mean, “how can I get stronger and have more muscle on my arms?” then it depends a lot on your overall health.  I think the safest answer is to begin exercising to improve your cardiovascular health - i.e., exercise to improve your heart and blood circulation.  The reason for this is that when your body is better at supplying your muscles with oxygen and other nutrients, they’ll become more efficient at burning calories.\n\nTo make this more concrete, let’s say you were lifting weights, but were only getting two reps out of ten.  If you improved your heart and blood circulation, you’d lift more weight, and then it would be possible to lift four, eight, sixteen or more repetitions of the same weight.\n\nIf you mean something like, “how can I strengthen the muscles of my arms?” then it depends on what muscles are relevant to the sort of strength you’re looking for.  Muscles in your arms can be strengthened through traditional weightlifting, and if you want to work your forearms, then you could also try pushups or weightlifting the upper body.  There are lots of other ways to develop your muscles,"}]}

The majority of people will have a single episode, but about 25% will have recurring episodes of low back pain over a period of years. With aging, low back pain is also expected to become more prevalent.\n\nCause\n\nPain in the lower back is caused by muscle or tissue damage. It may be caused by normal use of the spine, either in a forward flexed position (such as lifting), or in a flexed position that is held over time.\n\nHerniated disks are also a common cause of back pain, as are other types of back damage.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThis is most easily diagnosed by history, and by exam if further tests are required. The doctor will perform a physical examination, by touching and moving the patient's back to elicit painful areas. The doctor will also observe the patient's posture, and watch them move. They will examine for muscle spasm."}]}

But they’re also very active in providing services for the homeless.  The bell is usually rung in the evenings or early mornings, and the ringing is meant to signify hope and appeal for people in need to come into their buildings for help.  There’s a number for people to call 24/7 to request help, but it’s also available in person.  There’s no charge to people to get help, and people are actively encouraged to take advantage of this free service and not to feel ashamed about asking for help.  So it’s not just the physical bell, but the organization’s belief in this."}]}

Addiction is a condition where people repeatedly consume a substance, even when they know it's harmful for them.

People sometimes refer to this as a \"high\" because it feels pleasurable and can provide a sensation of well-being.  This chemical is also part of the reward system in the brain, so we feel rewarded when we engage in a behavior that produces this chemical release.

The 10 countries in the bottom half are more than twice as likely to be unhappy as the top 10 (Figure 1). The gap is quite wide in Europe. The 10 countries with the highest quality of life are also the 10 happiest. These findings indicate that many people live in poverty even though they are living in rich countries.

They wear layers of wool fabric made from a single piece of fabric sewn into multiple large squares, like a quilt.  These are called knickers.  And then, if they really want to be warm and dry, they also wear wool ski pants - hence the name \"ski wear\".

So basically, you’ll want to layer green food scraps from things like lettuce, cauliflower, green apples, etc. in the first layer of your compost pile, then cover it with a layer of brown stuff, like dryer lint or dry leaves.  When you do this, a soil microbe called a “predatory mite” will make the first stage of the compost pile grow. This “predatory mite” feeds on the life in the soil and is the start of the decomposition of the food waste. In order for your compost to turn into actual “soil” with all the nutrients in it that you want, you need to get to a second stage of composting with the “browns” where bacteria, fungi, and other microbes are present in the soil."}]}

It may be that the ability to peck in wood is connected to an anatomical feature that had another use, but evolved first, and it later became the basis for the pecking mechanism.  It’s also possible that other bird species at least experimented with pecking at wood, but never evolved the precise combination of features that woodpeckers possess.

And besides that, the last one is stainless steel, so you can use it to cook with, and the first one just says “stainless steel” but it might just be plastic, so that’s probably not what you want.

Anything else I can do to lower my blood sugar levels?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, it’s possible to have fluctuations in your blood sugar even if you are regularly active, since those factors don’t directly control how much sugar is available in your bloodstream. It’s possible that you are slightly more insulin resistant, which means that the way your cells use the sugar you eat may be a little bit slower. If that’s the case, you could ask your doctor about it, and they may recommend a medicine like Metformin to help. Otherwise, it would be great to keep up with exercise. You could try a fitness routine that includes a mix of high intensity workouts, like interval training, and more moderate cardio workouts. You can also also see if you can increase the amount of fiber you get in your diet. This would be a good idea anyway, since high fiber diets can help prevent a number of health problems.  Also, since exercise helps increase the uptake of glucose into your muscles, and since glucose is converted to glycogen and stored as fuel, it can be helpful to exercise if you are trying to lose weight."}]}

Korean people have a habit of eating spicy things with very sweet foods, so I think a nice dessert would go great with spicy kimchi.

The largest chocolate consumers are the United States, Switzerland, and Germany.  If we consider all the countries in the world, you’ll find that the US and Switzerland together have over 20% of the world’s population.  By this metric, it seems that if the US ate even a tenth of its current amount of chocolate, it would eat more chocolate than the rest of the world combined."}]}

Amala is one of those dishes that is an amazing example of “blending” different flavors and textures. The taste of the amala comes from the combination of the cumin, tomato, and cheese. It is hard to identify the specific flavors, because they meld so nicely together. The spices in the breadcrumbs and egg complement the tomato-ness and the cheese-ness of the main ingredients. The final texture is very smooth, and that helps the dish in general. Amala is also a dish that is very easy to make. A little forethought on your part in buying the ingredients, and then some effort with your hands (literally, not figuratively) is all you need."}]}

This should give them a chance to really explore what’s going on inside them, since asking about what they think about a topic lets them think about the issue in a way that’s not necessarily aligned with your own goals.

After boiling, take the pot off the heat and cover it, but don't stir the rice!  Let it sit for another 5-10 minutes, so that the rice cooks some more, and the grains can separate.  Don't overdo the boiling. Once the rice is tender, rinse it with cold water and drain, then drain your meat or chicken, if you're using it.  Put the meat or chicken in a large pan, with about 1 1/2 cups of water, some salt, and about 1 tablespoon of ghee.  Cook the meat or chicken in the ghee for about 10-12 minutes.

For a given application, the first step will be working on a research prototype. After demonstrating success, the goal will be to collaborate with product teams to assess feasibility offline before running experiments with that product.\nI envision applying a number of safety techniques to practical problems, including debate, fine-tuning language models with reinforcement learning from human or automated feedback, adversarial training, specialized classification language models (e.g., for inconsistency, subjectivity, illogical arguments, or evasiveness) that can be fine-tuned with supervised learning, conversational simulators, explicit models of user value to improve alignment and improved robustness techniques.\nI propose starting with more limited scope language tasks that should be easier to work with, while allowing for improvements to commercial products in the near term. For any of these tasks, there will be iterations on translating tasks into a form that can produce results in collaboration with safety researchers. In many of these, it would be valuable to apply specialized models to identify inconsistencies, incorrect arguments, falsehoods, subjective results, toxic language, unfair bias, or manipulation. These models can also be used to provide automated feedback, supplementing feedback based on ground truth answers.\n* Intent detection - this is used in mainstream conversational agents today to understand a user’s goals to direct a predefined conversation flow\n* Summarization - converting documents into shorter summaries would be very useful (especially if the results are more reliable than what has been possible to date).\n* Document relevance - allowing users to explicitly state what information they are looking for - this task is about finding semantically relevant documents\n* Generating descriptions,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh gosh, this is a very long, complex, and rich project description!

So if you were somehow to run into a gas leak, there’s really nothing you could do, right?  You’d be completely unable to take any action to stop the leak and just have to wait for someone to come and take care of it.\n\n\nBut on the other hand, if you DO install the detector, you’ll be able to detect leaks, and once you do that, you’ll know how to stop them.  So it’s as though you do have the ability to take action, but only if you install the detector. \n\n\nThis means that you can either stop a dangerous situation from happening in the first place, or you can help fix a dangerous situation that already exists. \n\n\nWhen making this"}]}

So, what I’m going to do is try to make some educated guesses here based on some general concepts of music history and culture, so hopefully I’ll have some accurate recommendations for you! One interesting development I have heard about in the 1970s is a proliferation of independent labels and music genres. One example is glam rock, a rock and roll genre which is often characterized by theatrical costumes, make-up and styling. This was popularized in the 1970s by groups like T. Rex, David Bowie, and Mott the Hoople. I also think it’s interesting that The Sex Pistols and The Ramones made punk rock popular, and one of the most influential artists of the 1970s was perhaps Bob Marley, an internationally acclaimed Jamaican singer-songwriter. The early 1970s also saw the beginning of disco music, which had an influence on almost every genre of music after that. But before that, we had psychedelic rock. This was a genre of music that emerged in the mid-1960s and was very influential on what came next. Finally, you might also be interested in some of the British bands that were most popular during the 1970s. One example is Queen, an English rock band that had number one hits with songs like “We Will Rock You” and “We Are the Champions”. Another band is Led Zeppelin, a rock band formed in 1968, who had the number one album “Physical Graffiti”"}]}

It’s really not that hard to keep the bacteria under control.\n\nSo that’s an introduction, now to the specifics of your question:\n\nKeeping the skin healthy -- and I’m using the word “healthy” to mean “able to do its functions well” -- can mean quite a few different things."}]}

Vesuvius.  \nBut to be specific about some of the cities, I think one of the main cities of Italy is Venice, and that’s located in the north. And also Florence is located in the center of Italy, and that is in the heart of the artistic capital of Europe. There is also Rome, which is the capital city.

If you need to patch it up, you can try to “boot” it: this is where you get a big, rubber-tipped boot (such as one used for curing rubber in auto repair shops) and insert it in the side of the mattress, and then expand the mattress from the outside, letting it expand into the boot and sealing up the hole."}]}

Sometimes just reducing your inflammation and the amount of work you’re doing on the area can help it heal faster. One technique I know that can help with this is called an “abstinence routine”, where you try to reduce how often you’re doing things that stimulate the tissue in the nose. This is helpful because if you do those things too much, it can actually increase your inflammation and keep the area inflamed longer. Some of the things to try to reduce doing in the nose are:  blowing your nose, sniffing, and picking at your nose. \n\nIf you can reduce how often you do these, that will probably go a long way toward healing faster. But of course your nose may feel raw to the point where you can’t help it and you just need to blow or sniff your nose. In that case, you may still benefit from trying to minimize these activities as much as possible. Also, if you are still having symptoms of the sinus infection, you can try adding an antiviral to your daily routine. These can also help to minimize symptoms so that you feel better faster. If that doesn’t help, you can try one or more of the"}]}

Chew sugar-free gum or a mint: This has a similar effect to prescription medication called a “proton pump inhibitor”, but can help to prevent the digestive process from starting at all, so it is not a prescription medication and you don’t have to worry about dosage. \n\n2.  Avoid large meals before bed: This can help to keep your digestive system from starting before you go to bed. \n\n3.  Try chewing fresh parsley: You can try chewing parsley, which is packed with vitamin C and several enzymes. It can also help to remove the gas buildup in your stomach. \n\n4.  Add probiotic supplements to your diet: You can consider taking a probiotic supplement, as this may also help to lessen the severity of reflux symptoms. \n\n5.  Try taking a digestive enzyme supplement: If these methods are not enough for you, a digestive enzyme supplement may help to speed up the digestive process. \n\n6.

And in turn, it might make you very attached to some of your possessions, or certain possessions, because you really value what they give you. I think this might be true at the individual level, but it might also be true at the societal level.

The clouds form because water molecules in the air are attracted to each other by intermolecular forces.  When enough water molecules clump together, there are enough of them to overcome the forces that keep them apart, so water droplets form.  Rain drops form when the water droplets grow big enough to overcome the forces holding them together, and they fall to Earth."}]}

Avoid “solutions” that are advertised as a perfect cleaning solution or as “like a towel but 100 times better”.\n\nDo not use a can of compressed air to clean the screen. Canned air is not an acceptable method for cleaning your screen. It may cause more damage to your screen by cleaning dust and debris.\n\nUse the factory cleaners on your screen.

The surgeon is usually not responsible, since they are not the ones who give the anesthetic.  However, they do have the responsibility to tell the anesthetist what they are doing and so that the anesthetist knows what they will do in the case that the patient wakes up and is able to feel pain.  This is because the doctor is considered the one in charge of the operation, and so they are responsible for making sure the patient is adequately anesthetized."}]}

A less-direct approach would be to build on their existing skills:\n\nTell them that the ski boots have laces, and they need to put them in their ski boots, so they can walk on the snow.\n\nTell them they need to get up and move around, because skis are slow to turn.\n\nTell them to try pointing their skis, and using their poles, to keep their balance on the snow.  “When you point your skis, your feet should be in the direction you’re pointing.”\n\nTell them how to move their feet, from a pointing-the-skis to a sweeping-the-skis to a sliding-the-skis position.  Tell them how to stop using the poles.\n\nYou could also let them wear a helmet, and practice maneuvering with your hands behind your back, but you don’t want to waste time with that if the child is already an experienced skier.

The vast majority of eggs used in the US and most other countries are “caged” in large farms, which typically include tens of thousands of hens packed into a single building. Often, these hens are unable to stretch their wings or move around freely, and live in cages where they can’t even spread their wings and fly if they wanted to.  They also can’t see the sky, and most can’t even see each other. \n\nThere is significant evidence that hens raised in cages have lower mental health and lower production of eggs. It is not unusual for a hen to live the majority of her life in a cage, and sometimes she lives in that cage for her entire life. While their are alternatives for cage-free hens in the US and elsewhere, such as cage-free range conditions, there is still not enough hens on these farms to satisfy the egg demand."}]}

Make sure to measure directly around your neck, over the place where you'd wear your collar.  I'd recommend going all the way down to the place on your neck where you'd wear your necktie.\n\nTorso: Next measure your torso by wrapping the string around your torso, just above your belly button, and down past your hips.  Make sure to wrap the string all the way around and make sure the tape measure is straight.\n\nArms: Next measure the circumference of your arms at the top, and down past the elbow.  Start with the tape measure around your right arm.\n\nLegs: To measure the circumference of your legs, use a tape measure around your thigh, just below your groin"}]}

The first is the testimony of consciousness given by men resuscitated by artificial means.  The reason which supports the illusion of memory in the latter, namely the actual contact between cerebral cells, and hence between different ideas, does not hold in the case of those who are really dead.  The proof of this is the fact that the whole is not necessarily conserved, for, if this were the case, the community of ideas should necessarily be conserved.  This"}]}

And as the air rises, it often rises through water, and as it warms the water vapor in the air, the water in the air condenses and releases water back to the surface.

The Union was initially successful, but General William T. Sherman was delayed in responding to the battle, and Confederate troops won the day.

The filtration material allows water from the top of the pond to pass through, but blocks most larger particles from passing through.  A filter system may need to be re-balanced if the water turns cloudy, and will need to be cleaned periodically.  Algae problems may become an issue, so regular checks may be necessary.

Another reason this question is complex is because we’re not clear what the word “best” really means. It could be interpreted in many different ways. Does “best” refer to the player with the most wins? Or the player with the most trophies? Or the player with the highest earnings? Or the player with the highest ranking in a list? Or the player with the highest win percentage? Also, it’s important to note that many golfers have won many tournaments in their career, but most of these tournaments have been won at the amateur level. Amateur tournaments are not held to the same standards as professional tournaments, so if we were to consider only professional tournaments then some players would rank higher than others."}]}

You asked for the “bow drill method” because that’s a common name for a way of starting a fire, which involves friction and heat, usually to ignite some kind of tinder. I’m not really an expert, but I think the easiest way to go about this is to imagine two branches. The main branch is a stiff stick, which is known as the “bow”. You’ll attach a little twig to it, using any kind of string or thread. Then you’ll hold the twig like a pencil in one hand, while you hold the other end of the string, in the other hand. You might want to first try making a simple bow-and-string combination, and experimenting with how it works. To make the bow, find a nice straight stick, about one-half to one-inch in diameter, and carefully select it for its straightness. Then take a strip of wood, about one-half inch thick, and whittle it to about half-inch wide. Use this strip to wrap the branch with string or tape, wrapping it about a quarter-inch in from the end. You’ll need to use a bit of leverage with this and it will be tiring. Do this all the way to the end. Then once you have a nice straight bow with string attached, you’re ready to try it. Take a piece of dry wood, and stick it into a section where the string hangs. Pull it up towards you, and hold it there. Then poke the little twig up against"}]}

Or there may be a situation where you’re trying to save money for a fixed sum.  For example, saving up money for a down payment on a car, or to send your kid to college.  In these cases, you should look into a savings account and if it’s tax-advantaged you can get a higher interest rate on your money."}]}

There are lots of similar preparations, all of which will feature some variations on the soup base: chicken, tomatoes, and coconut milk. Soto ayam is a clear chicken soup. Here’s a recipe you can use to make a version of it: Ingredients: 1 whole chicken breast 1 tablespoon chicken base 3 cups of chicken broth 2 tomatoes, diced 1/2 onion, diced 3/4 cup coconut milk (light or full fat) Salt to taste Instructions: 1. Chop the chicken into bite-sized pieces and put it into a large stockpot. 2. Add the chicken base and the chicken broth, and bring it to a boil. 3. While the stock is coming to a boil, dice the tomatoes. 4. Once the stock has reached a rolling boil, add the diced tomatoes and the diced onion. This mixture will make the “tomato stock” for the soup. 5. Once the tomato stock is boiling, add the coconut milk. The coconut milk will now be mixed in, but don’t worry, this is good! There is still more to add! 6. Add the diced chicken and stir gently so that all the chicken is submerged. Once the chicken is fully submerged, it is done! To make this into soto ayam, simply make a clear soup. Once it has reached a boil, add about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon of salt. This will give it a sweet and sour taste, which is typical. Add a bit more if you want to really make the soup taste salty, but I personally like to avoid this. Garnish"}]}

In some cases, especially assembly lines, robots are often used because humans are inefficient or unsafe, but in other cases, such as packaging or precision dispensing, it might be that a human is more flexible than a robot.

The advantages of steam are often the need to have a hot water source, and the ability to quickly release a large volume of steam.  The cons of the water pik are related to its performance as a water spray.  If you are using a water pik to spray water on plants, or hot things that need to be cooled off, or hot things that need to be heated up, you’re not likely to get much benefit out of steam.  You can put the water pik into a pot of boiling water to make steam, and the water it produces will still be an inefficient way to water.  I recommend a device like a PIG for targeted watering, that works much better than a water pik.  If you’re interested, I can recommend a specific watering device for you."}]}

One important thing to note is that President Obama was the first President who was born after the civil rights act of 1964.  Most previous Presidents were of a previous generation.  This means that Obama's views on civil rights and other issues were influenced by the same things that influenced other young people during that time period.  This may seem like a subtle point, but I think it helps explain some things that otherwise may seem puzzling about Obama's views.  For instance, one aspect of his legacy is his Affordable Care Act, a major expansion of the welfare state.  He passed the act, but it’s very expensive, and many Republicans blame Obama for the high cost of healthcare.  This makes some sense if you remember that the bill was passed while Democrats controlled Congress, and that civil rights issues were still on the minds of young people, who were influenced by the war in Vietnam and other things."}]}

One thing I can say is that even though it can feel like changing habits is something that takes a long time, the feeling that your habit is hard to change is also something that changes as time passes, so in the long run it’s a process that does get easier. This is something I’ve learned from my own experience, where my own habits have changed since I was younger, and I think that change is especially possible if we view it as a process instead of something you have to do all at once. In other words, if we think about our habits as something that’s on a trajectory from bad to good, it can give us a sense of empowerment and hopefulness to keep working on them, since it means that we don’t have to reach a perfect goal in a single moment, and we can keep trying and have lots of small positive steps. You can also keep track of how much you’ve changed using one or more of the techniques below: 1) If you think you can recognize when your habit isn’t well-controlled, you can keep a log of how often you don’t have that control, and what happens when you do or don’t have that control.

So, temperature: You should try to keep the room you put the cage in at around 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, during the day, and at around 70 degrees during the night.  Hamsters in the wild like to dig, so they might be better with some sort of climbing material to provide them with more stimulation.  They're omnivores, so they'll eat both dry food and wet food.  It's easiest to buy store-bought hamster food, but you can also make your own at home by mixing together some seeds, oats, and vegetables.  They like to drink only from water bottles, but to get them to drink a lot more, you'll want to add food coloring, since they like to think that their water is colored.  You'll also want to add some sort of soap to their water to make it taste better, since they don't like to drink just plain water.  Are there any other questions I can help you with?  I'm happy to try to answer them."}]}

Add 3⁄4 cup of whole milk and 1⁄2 cup of heavy cream.  Bring to a simmer and then remove from heat.  Mix in 1⁄4 cup of butter, 1 cup of cheddar cheese, and a pinch of salt.  Use an immersion blender (or use a blender if you have one) to make it all smooth. \nThe cheese ball is a very messy thing to make, but worth it, if you can keep all the cheese pieces intact."}]}

All of them are perfect for developing your abs, so I would recommend starting with whichever one you're most interested in, and then trying all the others too. First up: planks. A plank is a basic exercise, and you're probably familiar with it: it's just a flat, rigid position, with the body on all fours and both elbows and toes on the ground, or very close to it. Like this: The best way to practice it is to hold it for as long as you can. You can count seconds, or you can set a timer. Once you get good at the plank you can try doing some other versions of it, like a forearm plank, where you keep your forearms on the floor in a plank-like position, or an overhead plank, where you hold your body up on your toes. Next up: V-ups. The V-up is a very versatile exercise and can be performed with a variety of different modifications. It's simple to perform, it's great for building your core strength, and also good for developing flexibility. Like this: One very basic version is to do it with your hands on the floor, in a plank position. Try holding this plank up for 30 seconds, and then lowering down to the floor. Repeat this 3-5 times. Then try it with your hands on a chair, but still in a plank position. Repeat this a few times. Then try it with your hands on a higher surface, like a table,"}]}

This also requires an understanding of cause and effect, or instrumental learning. This can be tested by keeping track of how many pecks a crow makes before they get food. This task shows how smart an animal is at using simple tools to solve problems.

Then, some bacon, lard, onions, celery, carrots, leeks, mushrooms, and garlic are sautéed in a separate pan. In the skillet where the meat has been sautéed, there are pork livers, the flavoring of the risotto. Then, tomatoes and anchovy paste are added. The Italian Wikipedia states that the most common method to add the risotto is to use “tomatoes and wine”; the addition of the risotto is made using chicken broth, and the “risotto” is stirred until it “is no longer runny.” It can be served with melted pecorino cheese."}]}

Here are a few ways you can try mindfulness meditation out, some of which you can easily do now! - Try walking, or sitting, and noticing all the details of your body. The way your clothes touch your body. The air. The way you feel the ground. Try to notice your whole body, not just the parts that you want to pay attention to. Also, notice the details of your surroundings. Don’t focus on what’s really happening in the world, but pay attention to the sounds and movements in your immediate environment, and also your body and your mood. - When you notice that your mind has wandered off into the past or the future, try bringing it back to the present moment. Don’t be annoyed or hard on yourself. It happens, and it’s natural. But just notice, and gently bring your attention back to the here and now. - One more thing that you can do that’s a really simple but effective exercise is to do this: - Sit or stand with your hands in your pockets or by your sides.

Hospices are typically run by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, home health aides, and other professionals.

The next step is to be with the parent in the car, and the parent can then demonstrate driving and the child can then try it for themselves. The child must be supervised while driving, and this is for safety reasons.

It is made with flour and water, and the phyllo dough gets stretched until it’s very thin.  This makes it easy to roll the dough into a thin sheet, so that it fits into a baking pan.

However, he grew so proud that he decided to flee the island of Crete where he lived with his father, and fly to the land of the Sun in order to see the results of his father’s work.  Daedalus had created wings for himself and Icarus so that they could escape Crete, but told Icarus to fly with caution.  The two young men took off, but when Icarus flew too close to the Sun, the wax holding the feathers together melted, and he tumbled to his death.  Daedalus was disconsolate at the death of his son, and continued to the land of the Sun, but not to escape as Icarus had done.  He went in order to honor his son and give him a proper funeral."}]}

If we thought that murder had a bigger social cost than drug crimes, we’d have a higher willingness to pay for the cost of a prison sentence, and would probably also be more inclined to see drug crimes as more serious than murder.

Let’s say you’re driving a car.

There’s a woman in the crosswalk, but you don’t see her because your attention is on driving your car. So you run her over and she dies. This is voluntary manslaughter. Next, let’s say there’s another woman in the crosswalk, but she runs out in front of you. So you hit her, but she’s not a threat to your life or your ability to safely drive your car. So you’re not trying to kill her or take her life, but she’s hit by your car and dies. This is involuntary manslaughter. Now let’s say there’s someone who is running towards your car, and you’re going to run them over if you don’t move. So you move, and they’re now in your way, but you’re still going to drive your car over them and kill them. Then they move, and you hit them and they die. This is first degree murder.

Of course, if you aren’t using those muscles, you won’t be developing them. So another idea is to also perform exercises that help maintain the strength of those muscles."}]}

I could choose to compare her to specific players, which would be somewhat arbitrary and likely to provoke disagreement.  If I were to use statistics, for instance I could compare her career Grand Slam win percentage, which is 71.9%.  This would then compare her to other players, but this still would not capture the full measure of her accomplishments, and a reasonable observer might still disagree.

Another fun thing to try is paper rosettes.  Make a circle by folding a piece of paper in half, with the long side towards you.  Then, starting on the outside edge of the circle, fold in half again, in a diagonal direction.  This gives you an “X” shape.  Now open the “X” and flatten it.  This is a rosette.

If you want, you can mix it around the pan, so you don’t have to separate the seasoning into multiple bowls.  After this, place the chicken back into the oil.  Add the seasoning to the frying oil, then cook the chicken another 4 minutes, or until it’s slightly golden and ready to eat.  Remove the chicken from the frying oil.

Even if they were shown as bad guys, you’d usually see them getting their just deserts in the end.  So some Western observers take these things as propaganda."}]}

Men may not think about this consciously, but it may have an impact in how it plays out in their behavior. Another way to look at it would be to say that men and women naturally have different natures, and different things get us excited. Women in particular tend to find holidays like Christmas very exciting, and to focus their excitement on these kinds of occasions."}]}

Aging also affects the production of new cells, which means that your body isn’t producing new cells to replace the ones that have died, so the cells that are left are the ones that were originally there.  When a cell is new, it also has certain characteristics like greater energy levels and more efficient functions.  After the cell has been around for a while, it uses less energy to perform the same actions, and it’s also less capable of performing certain tasks.  For example, cells in your hair are constantly getting replaced, and some older people will notice their hair getting grayer."}]}

In fact, one study estimated that in 2040, robotic humans will be the norm, but it’s also a very fragile science and a little bit less predictable.  That said, there are some people who think we might be able to transfer a person’s consciousness into a robotic body.  And it’s possible that future versions of humans could also be merged with machines, for example, through an artificial consciousness.  A related area of research involves people with AGI (artificial general intelligence) who would like to merge with robots."}]}

Some of the best ways to do this are through walking and cycling, as they help you to maintain your physical fitness while being environmentally-friendly and less damaging to the environment.\n\n2.

Getting an early and consistent sleep schedule ensures that your circadian rhythms are in sync, allowing you to function at your best when you need to the most.\n\n3.

The plants may die, and in turn, food crops may die as well.  This can lead to an imbalance of healthy animals and plants, and in turn, humans. \n2.  Plastic pollution: plastic containers can be used to hold water, and in this way, the water itself becomes polluted.\n3.  Water logging: when there is so much water that it cannot all evaporate, it is considered water logging, which can be harmful to plants and soil.  It can also cause the soil to be eroded away.  It can also cause mosquito-borne diseases.\n4.  Toxic waste: for some reason, humans often dump chemical waste in water supplies, which can have harmful effects on people.

Here’s an outline of what you might already know about the volume of shapes: -What is the volume of a regular solid? For example, suppose we have a cube. Then we can imagine cutting it into infinitely many smaller cubes, like slicing a cake. We can imagine putting these tiny cubes into a jar, or space for more, and then taking out one cube and repeating the process again and again. Each time we take out one cube, we get the same amount of space as was inside the cube we took out, plus a little extra, so we get an exact number of smaller cubes in. We can describe the exact number by the formula for the volume of a regular solid: Volume = length^3. This formula will work for a cube or for a cone or for a cylindrical tube, as long as the solid is rectangular, right? In the case of a 20-sided die, however, it would be difficult to imagine cutting it up into an infinite number of smaller cubes, and then fitting them into a jar and removing the one cube again and again. But that’s exactly what we’re going to do! We’ll imagine cutting up the die into a infinite number of cube-like parts, each of which is a regular solid with 20 edges. Each time we remove a cube, we’ll put the one we just removed back into the “jar” of space for one more cube. Then we can repeat the process to remove"}]}

Another is the norm of epistemic responsibility, which says you’re a good epistemic agent if you don’t accept any beliefs that aren’t justified in some way.  Yet another is the norm of curiosity, which says you’re a good epistemic agent if you don’t accept any beliefs that aren’t self-intuitively right.  If I’m interpreting you right, you think that we shouldn’t accept epistemic norms that conflict, so you’re actually going to pick some norm of acceptance that doesn’t conflict with the others.

Beta-blockers also act to stimulate the heart to beat slower and with less force, which reduces the amount of work that the heart has to do to pump the blood. They also act to increase the amount of potassium that the kidneys filter out of the bloodstream and excrete in the urine.\n\nACE-inhibitors prevent the production of ACE, an enzyme that constricts blood vessels, and thereby blocks the effects of adrenaline and raises the blood pressure. Unlike beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors do not cause the heart to beat slower or produce more potassium in the urine. These drugs act by interfering with the constriction of the blood vessels and reducing the workload of the heart, thereby lowering blood pressure."}]}

A helicopter has the same feeling, except the feeling is coming from below you, and there’s no need to push against the earth!  In fact, when a helicopter is hovering it uses the earth itself to push itself up.  How does it do this?  It’s actually an interesting question that gets into some of the details of physics that a lot of people can get wrong!  In very simple terms, the earth is actually constantly generating a constant force in the direction of the local gravity, and when we combine this with the air pressure, we get a large force pushing up at a really high speed.

The first antibiotic medicines were discovered in the 1880s, when doctors noticed that people who were sick with serious infections got better when they were exposed to a mold called Penicillium chrysogenum. This was actually a coincidence; the doctors didn’t realize that this substance was related to disease, they just noticed that the person getting better was also near the mold. That was before scientists knew what microbes were, so this was the first clue to their existence. It wasn’t until the 1940s that Dr. Florey first used penicillin to treat patients. In those days, penicillin was quite difficult to make in sufficient amounts, so Dr. Florey didn’t have any interest in developing it. Then in 1943, while Dr. Florey was a prisoner of war, another scientist named Howard Walter Florey was examining another mold called Streptomyces griseus, which he had previously discovered to be related to drug-producing molds. In his experiments, he accidentally contaminated a plate of culture, but kept the petri dish anyway because he was curious what it would do. He found that the contaminated culture produced a substance that was quite useful for killing bacteria, and he sent a sample to Dr. Florey in order to find out whether they could be used to treat patients. Dr. Florey tested the substances, and found that they were effective for treating various infections."}]}

It is a species of crocodile that is easily distinguishable from other species by its long and slender snout. Nile crocodiles are part of the tribe Crocodylidae and the genus Crocodylus. In the wild, Nile crocodiles grow up to 9 meters long, but the maximum length of an adult in captivity has been recorded at 15.2 meters.  Nile crocodiles are apex predators and rely heavily on their senses of sight, smell and hearing to locate prey. The preferred prey of Nile crocodiles is fish, but they will also eat small land animals.  Their common name comes from the Nile River in which they reside, and is in reference to the 'crocodile tears' that were thought to be shed by crocodiles when attacking their prey.  It is believed that Nile crocodiles were very common throughout Africa, but they are now threatened in many parts of their range.  Nile"}]}

You don't actually have to do those 50 push-ups if you think that's going to be too much (maybe you're already doing 25 push-ups every day), but I'd ask you to think about what those push-ups would really be like.

I think a good strategy is to find an easy and healthy diet and exercise program that is tailored to your needs, and to try to reduce your calorie intake so that you are feeling consistently hungry, and this will help you lose weight more easily. Also, it is true that if you lose body fat in one part of the body, you will lose it all over the body, so the goal is to lose body fat overall. If you want to target your stomach, and for example make a plan to only eat healthy foods, or certain foods or only certain amounts of those foods, or to do certain kinds of exercises or not other kinds, those are very specific strategies for specific body parts."}]}

Do not attempt to spelunk with another person unless you can see them, and they can see you.\n3.  Never try to explore with a child if you have not done so with an adult.\n4.  If you have to wear a helmet, make sure it’s rated to prevent rocks and debris from entering your skull.\n5.  Never climb past the ends of your ladders.  Climbing above the ends of the ladders is almost always dangerous, and can even cause a rock fall.\n6.  If the floor of the cave gets muddy, or wet, do not walk on it.  Instead, walk along the walls and wait for the mud to dry.\n7.  Never feed the animals or use your food as a weapon.  Always wear long sleeves and long pants, so they will catch any bites from animals.\n8"}]}

But there are other reasons why fabric softener may be helpful, such as causing clothes to have a lower risk of “pilling”, and changing the surface roughness of some fabrics. So if you think you may want to use softener, it’s probably worthwhile to make an informed choice based on your specific circumstances."}]}

The outline is the skeleton of the script, and it’s typically 4-6 pages in length.  The outline can also include notes and guidelines about where the script should go, and sometimes also about certain technical terms.  The loglines are the part of the screenplay that summarizes what happens in each scene.  They’re typically 1-2 pages in length and cover 2-3 scenes, and they’re the part of the script that shows what happens in the scenes.  I wouldn’t recommend trying to write a logline about a scene without first sketching out a scene-by-scene outline.\n\nThe acts of the screenplay are usually written from point-of-view, but they can also be written in third-person omniscient.  The acts are typically longer than the scenes, and each one begins with a description of what the scene looks like, and then gives some context about the main character in the scene, and then some of the main dramatic action that happens in the scene."}]}

It has a very basic character that doesn’t change, but the melody does seem to change at a much deeper level as it progresses. It starts with the piece being slow and hushed, and grows slightly faster as it progresses, but still very slowly. It eventually gets slower again, then stops completely, which is rare for a piece with such an ending. Night Music is another “miniature” for piano that is very unusual for Bartok.

When all electricity is supplied from renewable sources such as solar power, carbon emissions from electricity use are zero. As a result, the environment will be greatly protected. Currently, there is no single building that is not taking any electricity or energy for its heating and cooling system. As a result, the residents can expect to save approximately $7.9 million per year on energy bills.”"}]}

There are four classes of Major League Baseball free agents, based on a player’s age and experience level, so there are four groups. We can divide them into four categories:\n\nAn unrestricted free agent is someone who is not under contract with any other team.\n\nA Type-A free agent is a player who has been on the team’s roster for at least six years and has at least 10 years of service time. They have the highest compensation rights, which means their new team has to give them at least as much in compensation as they would have had if they had been a Type-A free agent the previous year. A team can only sign one Type-A free agent, and the one they sign gets to receive the Type-A bonus. \n\nA Type-B free agent is a player who has been on the team’s roster for at least four years, with at least two years of service time, and is at least 26 years old and has at least three years of Major League service. Type-B free agents are still valuable players, but they don’t have the same compensation rights. A team can sign as many Type-B free agents as they want, and the free agents will share compensation,"}]}

The British also insisted the Chinese give them free access to trade and that they accept foreign diplomats.\n\nThe Qing Dynasty disagreed with these conditions, so in retaliation they used their military forces to seize and destroy all British and French trade goods in Canton. The British responded by invading in June 1839, seizing Hong Kong. The Chinese agreed to trade under the conditions the British wanted in order to return Hong Kong, but the British were only going to return it if they got more trade concessions. The Qing dynasty and the British went back and forth like this for a while, but finally the Chinese agreed to sign the Treaty of Nanking in 1842.  The Treaty gave Britain Hong Kong in exchange for their dropping the demand for trade concessions, and allowed foreign warships in Chinese ports."}]}

But in the 1890s, chemists at the German company BASF began looking into other ways to extract quinine. They found that the compound can be extracted by creating organic compounds from inorganic compounds and then adding an organic compound to the mix, for example adding acetone to form the quinine compound.  They also found that this process can be done at high volumes, and can be stored and transported much more easily than the natural product.  The problem with the natural product is that it has to be extracted by taking huge amounts of the bark of the cinchona tree and is very labor intensive.   The artificial compounds are much easier to make, and the process allows them to be produced in much larger quantities.  This is a typical process known as synthetic production."}]}

For pumpkin pie, a common ratio is: 2/3 flour and 1/3 shortening, while for an apple pie the ratio is 1/2 flour and 1/2 shortening.  Adding liquid to this mixture can make the crust flaky and add flavor and texture.  Different kinds of liquid can give you different textures, such as cream, water, or even apple cider.

If you’re making larger pieces, you can cut them into triangles instead of squares.  Heat a generous amount of canola oil in a deep fryer, so the oil is about 3-4 inches deep.   Take a pinch of flour and put it into a plastic bag.  If you can, it’s better to use raw flour, but any sort will do.  Add the sliced bananas into the bag, seal the bag, and shake to evenly coat the banana pieces.  Once you’re satisfied that the bananas are completely coated, remove them from the bag and place them into the hot oil.  Fry the bananas in the hot oil until they’re lightly browned on the outside.

First, ripeness is something that should be sensed in each individual fruit, rather than relying on something like how the whole bunch looks.  That’s because individual fruits vary in when they ripen, and they’re usually picked before they’re fully ripe.  So instead of comparing avocados, you should pick one and use it as a reference to help decide how the other avocados taste.  Second, you should be aware of how they smell.  Check to see if the fruit has a strong, distinct odor, because that’s an indication of the ripeness.  So you can just pick one and smell it to see if it has a strong scent.

They may have a low failure rate and be more convenient to use than injections.  They also may be better for people who can't use the injections.

There are a lot of different titles for producers, and a lot of different levels of production that are needed to make a movie.

The person who finds the actors, sets up the locations, coordinates the shooting, and keeps track of the film crew is called a “line producer”. The person who chooses the people who will be on the film crew and who makes sure they get the resources they need is called a “producer” or “unit production manager”. The person who coordinates the budgets, and manages the resources to make sure that the movie is made is called “production coordinator”.  And of course there are more people on a film crew who have to be “coordinated” and they have different titles, like the “director of photography” or “art director”.

Now that I have some more info, I'll just jump in! I can think of some good advice about flirting. So here's a common framework I think works well:  A lot of flirting happens indirectly, so you'll be more successful by playing dumb or giving ambiguous hints, rather than directly telling the woman you're interested.  The woman may not even know what you mean, but if you do it right you'll create a mental picture in her head that will make her really attracted to you.  \n\nHere's an example:  If I like someone, I might walk by and touch them lightly on the arm, while I make a gesture that seems natural and unrelated to anything flirtatious, like a yawn or a stretch. Then I might look the person in the eyes with a sly smile, and keep walking.  The woman might wonder why I touched her, what the yawn or stretch meant, and what was with the eye contact, but in this case, she'll find you very attractive.  I don't think she'll know why she found you attractive, but that's good, because it will create some intrigue and keep her coming back for more."}]}

That said, let’s take a look at some basic tips, and then we can talk about a few variations.\n\nWhen you first start out, it’s a good idea to get used to using an ice axe as an essential tool for ascending, and I recommend training with the tool for a few months before embarking on your first real climb.  This will help you get more comfortable with its handling, and will also give you a chance to get used to its bulk and weight.  Once you’re ready for the adventure, you can check out the Matterhorn website for some tips on equipment.  But my main suggestion for a novice climber is to get help from a friend or"}]}

Are you mostly happy with the shape of your face?  Your hair color?  The expression on your face?  The size of your nose?  Or something else?  Also think about the overall impact you want to create in your photos.  Do you want to look really happy?  Really sad?  Serious?  Whatever it is, that’s a good thing to think about.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why do they believe they should not receive blood infusions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Jehovah's Witnesses have a strict set of beliefs regarding blood, because it was a subject that is mentioned specifically in the Bible.  The first book of the Bible, Genesis, states that God created humans after his image, and that this was something that no other creature could replicate.  So God’s instructions, to all humans, were that they could not eat any flesh with blood.  Humans could only eat plants, fish, or animals with the blood drained from them.  One of the Jehovah’s Witnesses beliefs is that the soul does not leave the body at death, and is instead sealed by the blood.  They believe this because Christ was “pierced for our transgressions” and was “sprinkled with his own blood”, which they believe was symbolic of the fact that he was carrying all of our sins as he hung on the cross.  When God created mankind, he told them that it was forbidden to consume blood or they would be disobeying him, and in turn God would be disgusted by them."}]}

A healthy person might need around 6-8 hours of sleep per day.  But others may only need 4 hours of sleep per day to feel refreshed.  I think it's worth emphasizing that a healthy person's sleep needs will probably also change over time and with different events in their life, so they might need more sleep in the middle of a busy month at work, and then less sleep in the next month during the summer vacation."}]}

And while the game may have a “realistic” stance on weapons, many of the weapons aren’t necessarily realistic in terms of how they actually behave.  This may be due to game mechanics, in which case the fact that guns are unreliable is baked into the gameplay, but it may also be due to a lack of realism in the way the game’s weapons handle.  Either way, if I were to guess, I’d say that this is another case where the game “went too far” in its fidelity to reality, and the “unrealistic” controls end up making it hard to use the weapon well."}]}

This would make them immune to smallpox.   It was a tricky process, but now we have a much better understanding of how the immune system works, and so we can protect people from infectious diseases very safely and effectively.  \nVaccines are also extremely important today, as they protect people from many diseases.

Also, clumping litter tends to form a solid, dense block which may help with eliminating odors.  Another benefit of clumping litter is that the clumps are easier to carry out, so it may be easier to carry the clumps to the trash rather than risk dropping clumps."}]}

I’d recommend checking for any visible tears in the tire, and checking the pressure gauge to see if it’s overinflated.  There are also rubber seals around the rim and axle that should be checked."}]}

I also wanted to stress that sometimes the smell of a food is similar to another food, and often there isn’t a perfect single comparison.

Many versions of Bloody Mary contain the same or similar elements, including having the protagonist find a mirror with a black stone in it.  They are often set on a night with a full moon.  A scary woman appears in the mirror, and tells the protagonist three secrets.  The protagonist then must repeat the three secrets aloud while facing the mirror, or she’ll die, and so will anyone who's close to her.  A lot of the versions differ in their specific details, but these are the ones that are most common."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I've heard sniffing paint is bad for you. Why?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, a couple of different elements in paint can be toxic or poisonous. There are probably already toxins in the air inside the house, and the stuff you get from paint can be pretty toxic too. Some of it can get into your body if you breathe it or if it gets into your eyes. If you are allergic, then inhaling the paint can trigger an asthma attack. But that only affects a tiny fraction of the population, so it's quite unlikely. Paint-fumes can also cause cancer, but that is a long-term thing, so it is unlikely you'll get cancer from sniffing paint.  This is all really unlikely to happen though, and if you only paint things for a few minutes at a time, you will probably be okay."}]}

My feeling is that if you want to be as nice as possible to Santa, and you’re also trying to avoid tempting bad behavior by the kids, you should leave some cookies out.  But I don’t think it’s a good idea to leave cookies out as an automatic “always” situation.  When you really care about the kids, and you want to be careful with how they’re raised, leaving cookies out is a nice gesture but also an easy trigger for bad behavior.  Kids who are used to having the house filled with cookies for Santa are less likely to have a “bad” reaction to receiving cookies, because they’re more “used to it”.  This is not to say you should never leave out cookies, but it’s good to put a little thought into when and where you’d do it."}]}

As you may have heard, people in sunnier, southern places have lower rates of Vitamin D deficiency.  Ideally, there’s a lot of vitamin D-enriched food available to you that’s less expensive and easier to get than vitamin supplements.  There’s also some research suggesting that sunshine will also help your body produce Vitamin D more effectively, but there are lots of other possible benefits of sunlight, like vitamin C production, and boosting of mood.

The USA then really didn’t do anything to stop them, since it was expensive to provide military support, and in their view this wasn’t worth it, and they would just need to look out for themselves if they wanted to be safe.  However, it was really unsettling for the Russian leadership to see that the USA would take a firm stance against them, and they were left feeling very vulnerable.

In a draw there are points for the team that scores the most touchdowns, and another point for each team that has a successful field goal.  For non-regulation games that are tied after one quarter of play, the points will be awarded to the team with more points, regardless of the tie-breaking system used.  But the common tie-breaking system is for the teams to pick which end of the field they want to play from in the second half, and then they’ll play the remainder of the game using the first half points as points towards the tie-breaking score."}]}

They were known for sending diplomatic embassies to other countries in the area, like North Africa and what is now called Russia.  They were keenly interested in learning about what was going on in the world.  In fact, they were such a prominent power, and had such an impressive navy, that the Catholic church sent them missionary monks in an attempt to convert them.  They built churches like this one in Stavanger, Norway, right on the water, in the shape of ships.  They probably tried to convert the Vikings because they were concerned about the threats the Vikings posed to their other efforts in the region, like converting Christians in the countries they were conquering.  The Viking lawmaker Haakon the Good lived a century before the church’s missions to the Vikings.  He was very interested in Christianity, and was intrigued by the idea of converting to Christianity.  He wanted to make sure the laws were right before he did so, but he didn’t want to make any fundamental changes to the Viking way of life, since it was well established, prosperous, and had been working well for a long time.  He was very famous as a legislator.  In addition to his Viking laws, he wrote up laws in a Christian form to be used in his kingdom, called Norway."}]}

Because the Chaghatai Khanate’s ruling dynasty was the Yüan Dynasty, which was populated with people of the Yü-Ts’ai ethnic group, this name was later used to refer to Chinese people of Mongol ancestry, including the Manchu ethnic group who conquered the Ming Dynasty in China.

But if you're trying to make your closet last a long time, or if you have a lot of clothes that you want to always find, it's important to have a system that makes them easy to find.  An appropriate system would be something like this:\n\n* Fold shirts and pants with fold-over collars inside out.  (Remember to keep them facing the same way so you can tell which ones are right side out.)  You can fold other items as you like, but it's good to keep them symmetrical.\n\n* Put underpants, socks, and similar things in a separate drawer or basket, since they don't take up much space and the fabrics are not suitable for hanging.  If you store them in a bag, make sure they don't overlap and you can get to them easily.\n\n* Make sure you can easily get to the more used clothes in your closet.  If you store"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some good artists from the 1920s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alright, I can give you some suggested names and a description of their artwork.  The painter Vincent Van Gogh was an important artist in the late 1800s, who focused on what we call “Expressionist” art.  He believed that the artist should reflect their feelings in their art, rather than trying to describe them.  That means that there will often be very high emotion or intensity in his paintings.  And an interesting result of this is that some people don’t really like Van Gogh’s paintings.  For instance, when you Google his painting The Starry Night, you’ll see lots of people sharing photos of it on social media saying things like “I hate this painting” and “It’s gross.”  Other people find the high emotion of the painting intriguing or refreshing, and enjoy it.  So when thinking about a Van Gogh painting, keep in mind that he might have painted something you find exciting, but other people might find it upsetting.  For instance, let’s say you found the painting Starry Night exciting.  Some of the other paintings I’ll mention could be similar to Starry Night, so be prepared to see some pretty intense artworks."}]}

One famous writer I like, Albert Camus, had some helpful insights when he thought about the difficulty of relating to death.

To be honest, if the two animals are introduced to each other, then I would bet that they will get along just fine, assuming they are both friendly toward humans and other cats.  \n\nBut I’m sure you have heard stories about how one family pet was in the yard with another family pet, and then suddenly their relationship changed for the worse. Well, the truth is that this will not necessarily happen with you and your cat, but a realistic answer is that cats can certainly be territorial and have nasty behavior if their social space is infringed upon, even by something they’re normally friendly toward. So I would just keep an eye on the interactions and if there is any danger, you should act on it and keep your cat and rabbit separated.  \n\nIn terms of why you want to get a rabbit, there is no reason to not get a rabbit, but you should be aware that rabbits are energetic animals, they need to run around and jump, and your cat may not necessarily be happy with that. The same is true with any animal you add to the family, like a dog or a bird, and you have to be aware of how the animals interact and respect the boundaries of your animals."}]}

The inhabitants of the Northern Island, Molokai, consider themselves to be the most beautiful in Hawaii.  People who live in Lihue on the Central part of the Island of Hawaii feel that this island is the most beautiful, whereas those who live in the Eastern and Southwestern parts of the Island of Hawaii (such as Ka'u on the Big Island and Lahaina on Maui) feel that they are.

When the FBI failed to follow up with an investigation, Lewinsky decided to contact Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Her cooperation with Starr's office became the basis of the charges of perjury against Clinton. She was never charged with obstruction of justice.\n\nThe allegations of sexual misconduct by Clinton, first publicized on January 21, 1998, in the Ken Starr Report, included a claim that Clinton had had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky which had started in 1995 and continued until 1997.  Though Lewinsky claimed not to have had a sexual relationship with Clinton, she did acknowledge an intimate friendship with the President.\n\nIn the legal proceedings that followed the allegations, Clinton, the first president to be impeached in more than 100 years, was acquitted by the Senate, after being charged by the House of Representatives"}]}

That is an interesting question, and the answer can be difficult.  The answer depends on who you ask.  Most scholars who work on early medieval Europe agree that King Arthur was a real person, although they disagree about the details.  You might like to read about this.  I wonder if you might have heard this in movies or books, and just assumed that the movie makers are correct.  I’d encourage you to try to find out more about the history of Europe from around 600 to 1200 AD, which is called the “Dark Ages”.  Have you heard of the First Crusade, for example?  If you read about this, you’ll probably also hear about some famous leaders from this period, and King Arthur was probably one of the best-known figures.  If you start reading about him, you might be surprised at how many people know of him, and what they know.  I’d recommend that you start reading at least one biography of him.

I do know that going to a tax preparer does require you to have information about your personal circumstances and there’s a fee for that.  I’m not sure how much that is, but I don’t know if it’s cheaper than going to an accountant, which would be a paid position."}]}

Some folks might like \"Did you know they just started selling coconut milk by the pint in the gas station near my house?\"  But, the most important thing is to have fun, I think.  It can help to remember that what someone is saying is not about you, and that the key to making a connection is being a good listener and having an open mind."}]}

I think I have heard that Android allows for customization while iOS requires a phone to be jailbroken in order for customization"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm afraid I don't know what that means, so I'll just read it as saying that you think there’s a contradiction in what I’m saying about how customizable Android and iOS are."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How exactly would it destroy the country?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It depends on how much material is ejected by the eruption, and how far it’s thrown.   In some cases, huge amounts of material might be hurled out of the volcano with enough velocity that it would leave the atmosphere and travel all the way to outer space.  For example, one possible case would be that enough material would be ejected that it would impact the atmosphere of the moon.  Then there’s a chance that the moon would get ejected into space, or just get sent careening off-course into deep space.  If enough material is ejected in such a way that it flies past the moon, there’s a chance that the debris could then impact other planets in the solar system, like Mars."}]}

The only way to know for sure is if you have a plunger designed for sinks."}]}

Let’s break those down into chunks, so you can keep them organized, and ensure that you’re doing them all.  For instance, a “workout” might be an exercise that’s 30 minutes, and you’d split it into 5 separate 10-minute chunks.

Humans, birds, and livestock have been eating them for a very long time.
